A claim which i believe to be untrue! This film is more understandable than expected throughout many of its parts and does a good job of focusing the viewer's attention on details which are important to the story later on. Whilst a second watch will only further this understanding, I personally feel this is not a necessity. However, this film is a challenge to follow perfectly and I'm sure that most viewers (including myself) will leave questioning certain details. The sound mix is also not as bad as many suggest and is only noticeable in energetic action sequences which may be a choice to immerse the viewer as I'm sure it is hard to hear clear dialogue whilst bullets are flying! If you have the attention span and like a film that challenges your understanding of the world then this is definitely worth a watch!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Final Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2051194393", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.", "uploadDate": "2020-08-22T05:38:42Z"}}
