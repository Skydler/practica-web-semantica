Kristin Wiig was a masterpiece of miscasting. She wasn't funny; she wasn't scary, but great costume. The whole plot was a vehicle to resurrect Chris Pine, but there was no real chemistry between them. It made the lines of endearment quite awkward and the embraces seemed forced. All the usual tropes: WW loses some of her powers, so there can be suspense; she plays Spiderman and holds two vehicles apart. Just nothing new and Gad Gadot proves again that she's a glamour model and poses well. She can't act. Still - entertainment in a vacuum of good movies, so watch it and be distracted for TWO AND A HALF hours.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT2H31M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Stream on HBO Max for a Limited Time", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3240214809", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQ0NGM2NGMtMDE1Yi00YzQyLWI1ZWYtMmQ2OWEzZTA5YjEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQ0NGM2NGMtMDE1Yi00YzQyLWI1ZWYtMmQ2OWEzZTA5YjEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg", "description": "Fast forward to the 1980s as Wonder Woman\u2019s next big screen adventure finds her facing two all-new foes: Max Lord and The Cheetah.", "uploadDate": "2020-12-07T01:51:07Z"}}
