The first WW movie was not that great, but Patty did not write that one, this sequel she did and it is worthless. I was wondering if I was watching a drama or a action hero franchise. First the movie is far to long, the dialogue's are pointless and boring, you can skip with ease them because the story is not that complicated. For the action, the effects are good, not worth the time to watch, but still well made, but there are not very much action scenes. If you look at the demographic of the votes you can see girls <18 years are the only ones who love this movie, and that should have been the warning that should have been given with this movie: only see this movie if you are a teenage girl.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT2H31M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Stream on HBO Max for a Limited Time", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3240214809", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQ0NGM2NGMtMDE1Yi00YzQyLWI1ZWYtMmQ2OWEzZTA5YjEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQ0NGM2NGMtMDE1Yi00YzQyLWI1ZWYtMmQ2OWEzZTA5YjEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg", "description": "Fast forward to the 1980s as Wonder Woman\u2019s next big screen adventure finds her facing two all-new foes: Max Lord and The Cheetah.", "uploadDate": "2020-12-07T01:51:07Z"}}
